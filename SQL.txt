1. get all statuses, not repeating, alphabetically ordered
SELECT DISTINCT status
FROM tasks
ORDER BY status ASC 

2. get the count of all tasks in each project, order by tasks count descending
SELECT projects.name, COUNT(tasks.id) AS 'cnt'
FROM projects
LEFT JOIN tasks
ON projects.id=tasks.project_id
GROUP BY projects.name
ORDER BY cnt DESC

3. get the count of all tasks in each project, order by projects names
SELECT projects.name, COUNT(tasks.id) AS 'cnt'
FROM projects
LEFT JOIN tasks
ON projects.id=tasks.project_id
GROUP BY projects.name
ORDER BY projects.name ASC

4. get the tasks for all projects having the name beginning with “N” letter
SELECT tasks.id, tasks.name, status, project_id
FROM tasks
INNER JOIN projects
ON projects.id=tasks.project_id
WHERE projects.name LIKE 'N%'

5. get the list of all projects containing the ‘a’ letter in the middle of the name, and show the
tasks count near each project. Mention that there can exist projects without tasks and
tasks with project_id=NULL
SELECT projects.name, COUNT(tasks.id)
FROM projects
WHERE projects.name LIKE '_%a%_'
LEFT JOIN tasks
ON projects.id=tasks.project_id
GROUP BY projects.id

6. get the list of tasks with duplicate names. Order alphabetically
SELECT name
FROM tasks
GROUP BY name
HAVING COUNT(name) > 1
ORDER BY name

7. get the list of tasks having several exact matches of both name and status, from the
project ‘Garage’. Order by matches count
SELECT tasks.name, tasks.status
FROM tasks
INNER JOIN projects
ON projects.id=tasks.project_id
WHERE projects.name LIKE 'Garage'
GROUP BY tasks.name, tasks.status
HAVING (COUNT(tasks.name) > 1 AND COUNT(tasks.status) > 1)
ORDER BY COUNT(tasks.name) + COUNT(tasks.status) DESC

8. get the list of project names having more than 10 tasks in status ‘completed’. Order by
project_id
SELECT projects.name
FROM projects
INNER JOIN tasks
ON projects.id=tasks.project_id
WHERE tasks.status LIKE 'complete'
GROUP BY projects.id
HAVING COUNT(tasks.id) > 10
